This project allows to view a enemy pokemon's stat through DeSmuME Lua scripts. You also need to have a randomizer log for it to work (I will try to make it work by simply selecting the rom maybe one day.)

Step 1 - Download the files in the repertory.

Step 2 - Make sure you have the socket, tkinter, threading, time, os and PIL python module installed. Most of these are installed per default but some of them (Mostly PIL and socket) may not be installed at first. A quick pip install should be enough for them. 

Step 3 - Modify the python script so it opens the correct log file. (It will try to read a log.log file first.)

Step 4 - Execute the python script.

Step 5 - Open DeSmuME and launch your randomized Pokemon Black 2 ROM.

Step 6 - Go to the Tools > Lua Scripting part of DeSmuME and finally start the script.

Step 7 - Enjoy. Note you might want to put both your DeSmuME and GUI for more practical use.
